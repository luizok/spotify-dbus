## Introduction

TODO :D

## Usage

---

### Dependecies

The node package that connects to DBus needs to be compiled when downloaded. For this reason the following packages are dependecies:

```shell
sudo apt-get install libdbus-1-dev
sudo apt-get install libglib2.0-dev
```

After the previous downloads, install the node packages using:

```shell
npm install
```

### Run

To run the script, simply run in the terminal:

```shell
node main.js
```
